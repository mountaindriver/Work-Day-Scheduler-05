<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project was a school asssignment form week 5 of the University of Utah Coding bootcamp.  The goal was to create a " Work-Day-Scheduler" by adding JavaScript to a preexsiting repository with HTML and CSS.  These were the assignment requirements:

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
